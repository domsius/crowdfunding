# Getting Started with the Crowdfunding Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Use the Application

### Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/domsius/crowdfunding
cd crowdfunding
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Start the Backend

```sh
cd crowdfunding-backend
npm install
node app.js
```

### Access the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can open the application in your browser:
